# By defining a namespace under the routes.rb file. Rails will automatically map that 
# namespace to a directory matching the name under the controllers folder, in our case the api/ directory.

 # we didnâ€™t just add a constraints hash to specify the subdomain, but we also add the path option, and set it a backslash. 
 # This is telling Rails to set the starting path for each request to be root in relation to the subdomain(Box 2.1), achieving what we are looking for.
